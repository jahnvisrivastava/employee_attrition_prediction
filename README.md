# IBM Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using various machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and statsmodels. The dataset used is the IBM Employee Attrition dataset.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition, enabling organizations to take proactive measures to retain valuable talent. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and the application of various machine learning models to predict employee turnover.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Modeling:** Training and evaluating various machine learning models.
- **Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilizing `dmatrices` for design matrices in predictive modeling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account (optional, but recommended)
- Basic understanding of machine learning and data science concepts

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ibm-employee-attrition-prediction.git
   cd ibm-employee-attrition-prediction
2. Open in Google Colab

   Upload the repository files to your Google Drive.
   Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
   Import the Dataset

3. **Import**

   Make sure to upload the Ibm-Attrition-Employee.csv file to your Google Colab environment or specify the correct path if running locally.
   
4. **Run the Notebook**

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build models, and evaluate results.

### Usage
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab for ease of use. However, it can also be run locally if preferred. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the dataset is correctly imported before running the code.
